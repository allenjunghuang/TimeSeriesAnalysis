# System Identification

To understand structural dynamics, the dynamic response of a linear or non-linear systems, identification of system parameters, correction the mathematical models by experimental data.

## Parametric Approach

ARX (AutoRegressive eXogenous)

Final Prediction Error (FPE)

Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AIC)

## Non-parametric Approach

Frequency domain system identification using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to obtain transfer function. However, the signal transform from time-domain to frequency-domain could induce aliasing error, leakage, picket-fence, etc.


## Model Evaluation

- Correlation coefficient 
- Harmonic distortion
